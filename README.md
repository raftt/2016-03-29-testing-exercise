[![Build 
Status](https://travis-ci.org/raftt/2016-03-29-testing-exercise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raftt/2016-03-29-testing-exercise)

## Getting started

* Fork this github repository to your own user account on github
* Clone the repository from your own fork so that you can work on it on your
  computer.
* Login to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) with your GitHub account and activate (your fork of) this repo for testing.
* Edit this README file and replace all mentions of `raftt` in the link above with your user name.

## Improve the code
* Implement missing functions to make the unit tests pass (run tests either locally or let Travis run them for you each time you push changes).

### How to run the tests locally
To run the test on your machine, use the [pytest](http://pytest.org) package (should already come pre-installed with Anaconda).

In the directory where you cloned the repository, run:
```Python
py.test -v preprocess.py
```
